// I want  the first two graphs
// Number of Customers vs Time Graph (n(t))
// Shows the step-wise progression of customers in the system over time
// Clear visualization of when the queue reaches capacity (k)
// Demonstrates the cyclic pattern after t_i (first balk time)
// Different patterns for λ > μ and λ ≤ μ cases
// Waiting Time Graph (Wq(n))
// Shows waiting time for each customer number
// Linear increase until queue reaches capacity
// After t_i, alternates between two values
// Different patterns for stable vs unstable cases
// and
// Customer Flow Diagram
// Visual representation of arrivals and departures
// Shows blocked customers after queue reaches capacity
// Timing diagram style with arrival and service completions

// and let's start by implementing the first one only for now

// using rechart library
